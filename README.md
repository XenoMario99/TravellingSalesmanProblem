# TravellingSalesmanProblem
This project implements the "Travelling salesman problem" algorithm basing on dynamic programming.

This algorithm is aimed at finding the shortest way comprising all cities on a travelling salesman way.
The input is 2D array containing distances between any two cities (the value -1 means there is no way between such cities, whereas 0 denotes distance from a city to itself).
